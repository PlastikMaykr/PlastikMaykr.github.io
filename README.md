# DayDial

__DayDial__ is a web application that implements _time boxing_â€”a time management concept that involves allocating a fixed amount of time to a specific activity without distractions or interruptions.

__DayDial__ makes it possible to present and arrange your activities in two distinct but parallel ways. The first one is a Calendar with multiple Columns for event blocks. The other one, which is the feature making __DayDial__ unique, is the __Clock Chart__: a clock face with rings containing arches corresponding to the Calendar columns with event blocks.

__DayDial__ is designed to help you manage your time more effectively by providing a visual representation of your schedule and tasks.
